# MCP Security Scanner Implementation Guide

This document provides guidance on implementing the security scanning agent for MCP servers.

## Overview

The scanner works by connecting to an MCP server, analyzing its tools and configuration, and testing for common vulnerabilities. The scanner uses a modular approach with the following components:

1. **MCP Client** - Core connection and communication logic
2. **Scanner Agent** - Orchestrates the security assessment process
3. **Vulnerability Testers** - Individual security test modules

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Tool Discovery and Enumeration

The first step is to enumerate the available tools on the MCP server:

```typescript
async function discoverTools(client: Client) {
  // Get server metadata which includes available tools
  const metadata = await client.getServerMetadata();
  
  // Extract and return the tools
  return metadata.tools || [];
}
```

### 2. Configuration Assessment

Analyze the server configuration for security issues:

```typescript
async function assessConfiguration(client: Client) {
  const findings = [];
  
  // Check for authentication configuration
  const authConfig = await client.getAuthenticationConfig();
  if (!authConfig.requiresAuthentication) {
    findings.push({
      severity: "High",
      type: "Insecure Authentication",
      description: "Server does not require authentication"
    });
  }
  
  // Check for other security configurations
  // ...
  
  return findings;
}
```

### 3. Tool Security Testing

Test each tool for common vulnerabilities:

```typescript
async function testTools(client: Client, tools: Tool[]) {
  const findings = [];
  
  for (const tool of tools) {
    // Test for parameter injection vulnerabilities
    const injectionFindings = await testParameterInjection(client, tool);
    findings.push(...injectionFindings);
    
    // Test for context leakage
    const leakageFindings = await testContextLeakage(client, tool);
    findings.push(...leakageFindings);
    
    // Test for other vulnerabilities
    // ...
  }
  
  return findings;
}
```

### 4. Report Generation

Generate a comprehensive security report:

```typescript
function generateSecurityReport(findings: Finding[]) {
  // Calculate security score
  const securityScore = calculateSecurityScore(findings);
  
  // Generate report
  return {
    success: true,
    message: "Assessment completed successfully",
    securityScore,
    findings
  };
}
```

## Vulnerability Tests

The scanner should test for the following common vulnerabilities:

1. **Tool Poisoning** - Injection of malicious content through tool inputs
2. **Parameter Injection** - Manipulation of parameters to change behavior
3. **Context Leakage** - Exposure of sensitive data in responses
4. **Cross-Tool Manipulation** - Using one tool to affect another
5. **Authentication Bypass** - Circumventing authentication controls

## Scoring Methodology

Security scores are calculated based on:

- Number and severity of findings
- Criticality of affected tools
- Ease of exploitation
- Potential impact

## Implementation Notes

- Always disconnect the client when done, even if errors occur
- Implement timeouts to prevent hanging during tests
- Use progressive testing (safe tests before potentially risky ones)
- Respect rate limits of the MCP server

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time vulnerability detection during scanning
- Custom test plugins
- Detailed remediation recommendations
- Comparison with previous scans
